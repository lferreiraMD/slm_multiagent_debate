This is a fundamental condition for weak stationarity, distinguishing it from processes with time-varying means.\n\n2. **Autocovariance Function**: The autocovariance function \\( R(\\tau) = \\text{Cov}(X_t, X_{t+\\tau}) \\) must depend only on the lag \\( \\tau \\), not on the specific time \\( t \\). This means \\( R(\\tau) \\) is a function of \\( \\tau \\) alone (Condition iii). If this holds, the variance (which is \\( R(0) \\)) is also constant, but the variance itself is implied by (iii) rather than a separate requirement.\n\n3. **Constant Probability Distribution (Condition iv)**: Weak stationarity does not require the probability distribution of the process to be constant over time. Instead, it requires the process to be stationary in the statistical properties (mean and autocovariance), meaning the distribution at any time \\( t \\) is not necessarily the same as another time \\( t' \\), as long as the joint distributions over sliding windows of data match. Thus, (iv) is not a necessary condition.\n\n4. **Does Not Require Constant Variance (Condition ii)**: Since the variance \\( R(0) \\) is directly determined by the autocovariance at lag 0, and (iii) already ensures the autocovariance depends only on \\( \\tau \\), the variance being constant is a consequence of (iii), not an independent requirement. Hence, (ii) is redundant here.\n\n**Key Examples**:\n- An **MA(\\(\\infty\\))** process with a constant variance has a stationary distribution but a non-constant point distribution, showing that the distribution need not be constant.\n- A strictly stationary process (which requires constant variance and all autocovariances for all lags to be constant over time) is a special case of a weakly stationary process but adds more stringent conditions.\n\n**Conclusion**: The necessary conditions are (i) constant mean and (iii) constant autocovariances for given lags.
