{"Can you answer the following question as accurately as possible? In what ways does gender shape the conceptualization of nationhood and conflict?: A) Although often missing from the traditional literature on war and security, women frequently serve the purposes of nationalise causes, with nationalism often presented in highly gendered and female terms, where women are symbols of statehood., B) A sense of national identity can be developed through a variety of shared experiences, including war. The glorification of iconic national figures such as political leaders is not noticeably gendered and men and women generally perform the same types of roles within the public realm., C) Measures of national pride and success are biased towards the glorification of female attributes such as the ability to bear children. The restriction of women to the domestic sphere creates a sense of national identity that is founded on a celebration of home life, feminine strength, and maternal characteristics., D) When thinking about national identity, violence, physical strength, aggression, and the ability to use force are attributed as feminine characteristics.
