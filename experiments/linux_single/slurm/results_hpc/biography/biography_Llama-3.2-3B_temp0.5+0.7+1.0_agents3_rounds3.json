Turing Award for his innovative contributions to the theory of relational databases and propositional logic.\n\n\u2022 Smith worked as a professor at various institutions, including the University of Utah, the University of Wisconsin-Madison, and the University of Edinburgh, significantly influencing the fields of database and information systems.\n\n\u2022 He is a fellow of the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) and a member of the National Academy of Engineering.\n\n\u2022 Smith has published numerous papers on database and language theory and has edited several books, including \"The Practice of Programming\" and \"The Theory of Computation\", considered classics in the field.\n\n\u2022 He co-founded the research organization SRI International's International Computer Science Institute, where he continues to make significant contributions to computer science through his ongoing work in relational database theory and curriculum development.\n\n\u2022 Brian Cantwell Smith continues to be recognized for his achievements, having received numerous awards and fellowships for his research, solidifying his position as a pioneer and influential figure in the field of computer science."}]], "Edmund M.
