The PCP is a decision problem involving matches between two sequences of symbols that can be unsolvable even for relatively small sequences.\n- In 1946, proved the existence of undecidable problems, thereby advancing the field of computational complexity.

The PCP is a decision problem involving matches between two sequences of symbols that can be unsolvable even for relatively small sequences.\n- In 1946, proved the existence of undecidable problems, thereby advancing the field of computational complexity. This result demonstrated that some mathematical problems are inherently difficult and cannot be solved by a perfect, universal algorithm.\n- Post retired from CCNY in 1963 and died on January 7, 1954, in Long Beach, California.\n- Post's work laid the groundwork for many modern areas of computer science, including automata theory, formal languages, and computational complexity, and his influence on the field continues to be felt today.```\n\n Using these other biographies of Emil Post as additional advice, what is your updated bullet point biography of the computer scientist Emil Post?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": " -
