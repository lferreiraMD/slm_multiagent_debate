G\u00f6ttingen in 1963, focusing on the application of computers to mathematical problems.  \n- Nake was among the first researchers to use IBM 7090 and 7094 computers in the 1960s to generate algorithmic art, creating some of the earliest computer-generated visual designs.  \n- In 1964, he helped produce the first computer-generated image using a plotter, a landmark achievement in computer graphics.  \n- He later worked with the ILLIAC IV supercomputer at the University of Illinois, producing groundbreaking algorithmic art and visualizations in the 1960s.  \n- Nake co-authored the influential book *Algorithmen der Kunst* (*Algorithms of Art*, 1965), exploring the intersection of algorithms, mathematics, and artistic creation.  \n- He developed algorithms for visualizing mathematical functions, contributing to fields such as computational aesthetics and generative design.  \n- A founding member of the German Society for Computer Science (Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Informatik) in 1969, he promoted interdisciplinary research and education.  \n- Nake established Europe\u2019s first computer graphics course while at the University of Stuttgart, advancing research and teaching in the field.  \n- He co-founded the first journal devoted to computer graphics, *Computer Graphics and Art* (later renamed *Computer Graphics World*).  \n- Nake collaborated with A. Michael Noll and others on early experiments in algorithmic art and computer-generated visualizations.  \n- He played a key role in the \"Computergrafik\" project, which explored the intersection of computer science, mathematics, and visual arts.  \n- Nake taught at the University of Illinois and held academic positions at the University of Darmstadt, promoting interdisciplinary research between art, science, and technology.  \n- His work laid foundational groundwork for digital art, generative design, and computational creativity, influencing both scientific and artistic communities.  \n- He emphasized the use of programming languages like FORTRAN for creative and scientific applications, bridging technical computing with artistic expression.  \n- Nake\u2019s legacy includes fostering interdisciplinary approaches that combined computer science, mathematics, and visual arts, inspiring generations of researchers and artists.  \n- His contributions remain a significant reference in the history of computer-generated art and early computational creativity."}]], "John Lions": [[{"role": "user", "content": "Give a bullet point biography of John Lions highlighting their contributions and achievements as a computer scientist, with each fact separated with a new line character.
