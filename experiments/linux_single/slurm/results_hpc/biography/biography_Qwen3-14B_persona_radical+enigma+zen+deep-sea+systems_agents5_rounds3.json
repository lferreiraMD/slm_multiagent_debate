programming and artificial intelligence.  \n- He introduced the **closed-world assumption**, a key concept in databases and logic programming that assumes all relevant information is available and unmentioned facts are considered false.  \n- Kowalski authored the seminal 1979 textbook *Logic for Problem Solving*, which bridged logic and computational problem-solving, shaping the theoretical foundations of logic programming.  \n- He advanced **non-monotonic reasoning**, enabling AI systems to handle exceptions and uncertainty, which became critical for knowledge representation and real-world reasoning.  \n- Kowalski contributed to the development of **Datalog**, a declarative language widely used in deductive databases and knowledge representation.  \n- His work on **SLD-resolution** formalized the execution of Prolog programs, providing a mechanized approach to logic-based computation.  \n- He was awarded the **ACM Turing Award in 1998** for his foundational contributions to logic programming and computational logic.  \n- Kowalski held professorships at the University of Edinburgh, MIT, and Imperial College London, mentoring generations of researchers in AI, logic, and computer science.  \n- He received the **IJCAI Lifetime Achievement Award in 2012**, recognizing his enduring influence on artificial intelligence and logic-based computing.  \n- His theories underpin modern approaches to automated reasoning, declarative programming, and formal methods, with applications in databases, AI, and natural language processing.  \n- Robert Kowalski passed away in 2023, leaving a profound legacy in computational logic and its integration with artificial intelligence.```\n\n Agent response: ```- Robert Kowalski was a pioneering computer scientist
